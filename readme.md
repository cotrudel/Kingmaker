## Todo : 
- Find an awesome tokens for the party
- Save before quit
- Make fog more manageable (add and transparency)
- Adjust css to have all icon on the same size (more or less)
- Add a class to hide every menu at the same time when clicking on the background (use ".menu" ?)
- Use data instead of crappy class method like I did
- Add a hint on fields (name and title)
> Disable somes characteres on names
- Create capital

## In progress :
- Create factions
> Border  
> Color

## Maybe : 
- Load default file from web (currently data are store in js)
> Cross domain origin issue
- Move the edit box while moving the element
- Confirm delete element
- Add a recently use element
> Avoid / destroy and create box ?
- Put the dropdown to the default value
- Use a proper framework to do the stuff done by jQuery (vueJs, React, whateverJs)
- Add a calendar (or something that display date)
- What is the utility of the name of the element vs title ?
- Fill the dropdown automatically instead of using the crappy object

## Nope
- Possibility to choose map (use the kingmaker video-game map ?)
> No fog of war  
> No default map

## Known Bugs : 
- Fog wording
- Light fog / visited

Add icons for :

- Make elements movable on edit 
- Put js pluggins in local (usefull in plane)
- Make fog manageable (add and remove)
- Add link to the github
- Add link to Jon Pintar's deviant-art page
- Remove element
- Center the menu to open / create map
- Auto-enable checkbox on add item of this type
- Create a font to put icons in it (SVG, free icons / self made)
