# Kingmaker interactive map
The app is an interactive map for the Kingmaker campaign.    
It is **not** made for the [video game](https://owlcatgames.com/) but for the [paper version](https://paizo.com/kingmaker) (french version [here](https://www.black-book-editions.fr/catalogue.php?id=29)). 

You can either use the [site](http://kerchiefed-turnarou.000webhostapp.com/) or copy everything in local.

The map has been made by [Jon Pintar](https://jonpintar.com/).

## Todo : 
- Find an awesome tokens for the party
- Save before quit
- Make fog more manageable (add and transparency)
- Adjust css to have all icon on the same size (more or less)
- Use data instead of crappy class method like I did
- Add a hint on fields (name and title) : disable some characteres on names
- Create capital


## In progress :
- Create factions : Border  

## Maybe : 
- Load default file from web (currently data are store in js) : Cross domain origin issue
- Move the edit box while moving the element
- Confirm delete element
- Add a recently use element : Avoid / destroy and create box ?
- Put the dropdown to the default value
- Use a proper framework to do the stuff done by jQuery (vueJs, React, whateverJs)
- Add a calendar (or something that display date)
- What is the utility of the name of the element vs title ?
- Fill the dropdown automatically instead of using the crappy object

## Nope
- Possibility to choose map (use the kingmaker video-game map ?) : No fog of war, No default map
