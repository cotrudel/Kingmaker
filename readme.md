### Map
The map has been made by [Jon Pintar](https://jonpintar.com/).

### Copyright
I do not look after them when I get the pics.  
If you think the icons is your (it could be) and you don't want me to use it or want to have your name on the app, please, be my guest

### Help ?
Well ... you can create icons... Please...

## Todo : 
- Edit element
.- Change icon
.- Change category
- Add a hint on fields (name and title)
.- Disable somes characteres on names
- After load (or create) center on player token
- Create factions
.- Border
.- Color
- Use a proper framework to do the stuff done by jQuery (vueJs, React, whateverJs)
- Find an awesome tokens for the party
- Add a calendar (or something that display date)
- Save before quit
- Make fog more manageable (add and transparency)

## In progress :
- Create a font to put icons in it (SVG, free icons / self made)

## Maybe : 
- Load default map from web (currently data are store in js)
.- Cross domain origin issue
- Move the edit box while moving the element
- Auto-enable checkbox on add item of this type
- Confirm delete element
- Add a recently use element
.- Avoid / destroy and create box ?

## Nope
- Possibility to choose map (use the kingmaker video-game map ?)
.- No fog of war
.- No default map

## Bugs : 
- Fog wording

## Icons
Add icons for :
- Add element button
- Save changes button

## Done :
- Load default map
- Load file
- Save file
- Default map
- Edit elements (partial)
- Hide menu on load file (Create and Load)
- Make elements movable on edit 
- Put js pluggins in local (usefull in plane)
- Make fog manageable (add and remove)
- Add link to the github
- Add link to Jon Pintar's deviant-art page
- Remove element
- Center the menu to open / create map
