## Todo :

> Change category
- Add a hint on fields (name and title)
> Disable somes characteres on names
- After load (or create) center on player token
- Create factions
> Border  
> Color
- Use a proper framework to do the stuff done by jQuery (vueJs, React, whateverJs)
- Find an awesome tokens for the party
- Add a calendar (or something that display date)
- Save before quit

## In progress :
- Create a font to put icons in it (SVG, free icons / self made)

## Maybe : 
- Load default map from web (currently data are store in js)
> Cross domain origin issue
- Move the edit box while moving the element

- Add a recently use element
> Avoid / destroy and create box ?
- Put the dropdown to the default value

## Nope
